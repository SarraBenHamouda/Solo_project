Project Idea: To-Do List App
I’m planning to build a To-Do List App using React for the front end and Node.js with Express for the back end. The app will allow users to manage their tasks efficiently with various helpful features. Here’s a brief overview of the core functionalities:

1. User Authentication
Users can create an account or log in to manage their personal tasks.
This ensures data is secure and personalized for each user.
2. Task Management
Users can:
Add new tasks.
Edit existing tasks.
Delete tasks they no longer need.
Tasks can be organized by categories such as:
Work
Shopping
Personal
This makes it easier to prioritize and manage tasks across different aspects of life.
3. Task Filtering and Searching
Users can filter tasks based on:
Priority (e.g., high, medium, low)
Category
A search function will allow users to quickly find specific tasks within their list.
4. Progress Tracker
A visual progress bar will show users the percentage of tasks they have completed.
This feature motivates users by giving a clear view of their progress.
5. Drag-and-Drop Functionality
Users can rearrange tasks using a drag-and-drop feature.
This adds flexibility in how they organize their task list.
6. Database Storage
MongoDB will be used to store:
Task data (task details, status, etc.)
This ensures scalability and efficient data management.
